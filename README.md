## Tools
- [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
- [Spring Framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/annotations.html)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Demo
Below is the video explaining the direct functioning of the API. 
Watch the video and understand the process of its creation
